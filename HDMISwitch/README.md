This is the bulk of the repo.
It contains a single source file main.cpp which contains the whole arduino source (great organisation I know).

It also contains copies of the source of 3 libraries which should probably be handled some other way.... :
Bounce2  : switch debouncing       : https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2
SoftWire : software i2c            : https://github.com/stevemarple/SoftWire
TimerOne : timer interrupt handler : https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/TimerOne
